![Photo Service Demo](demo.gif)

### Description
This is the photo carousel micro service and modal for a property listing application. This service was created by me for use within the larger propertly listing application (link below).

The frontend is build using react functional components (with hooks) with visual styling through CSS. The Backend is built using Express with a MongoDB database. The service was containerized using Docker and deployed to AWS.

### Setup
1. Compile bundle.js: `npm run build-dev`
2. Seed the database: `npm run seed`
3. Start the server: `num run start-dev`
